# 👋・About me 


My name is Raphael, and I'm a 20-year-old maritime student. However, development is a hobby that I am passionate about. Since high school, I have discovered my interest in development and started exploring this fascinating field. Initially, I started creating Discord bots, but over time, I have expanded my skills. Currently, I focus on building small web applications. On my GitHub, you will find utility projects that can be helpful for your own projects. I'm excited to share my creations with you.
